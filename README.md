# Datasets and models
At the moment, the bot can distinguish 4 classes 
- acne (acne)
- exophthalmos (Bazedova disease)
- goiter (Bazedova disease)
- yellowed eyes (varieties of hepatitis)

At the time of the work, these diseases were selected, since there was an opinion that these diseases are characterized by related sign, and they are easiest to find. Further work pre -regulates the expansion of classes, an increase, and the balancing of the dataset, and the improvement of the quality of models.
